# Network Management endpoints

This API component provides a large number of endpoints for creating, listing, and deleting networks, as well as viewing and editing network settings, checking for network existence, determining whether upgrades are necessary, and uploading and deleting splash pages.

### create network
`POST /network`

Create a new network and associate it with the user sending the `create` request.

Characteristics of the new network are defined by the JSON package that comprises the body of the HTTP request.  At a minimum, the following four fields are required. The password must be at least 8 characters long:

* `name`
* `password`
* `timezone`
* `country`

##### example request

````
POST https://api.cloudtrax.com/network
POST https://api-v2.cloudtrax.com/network/networkgroup/<id>
````

##### input example
```` json
{
    "name" : "my-test-network-#2",
    "password" : "some_password",
    "email" : "support@open-mesh.com",
    "location" : "Portland",
    "timezone" : "America/Los_Angeles",
    "country_code" : "US"
}
````

##### output

The API either returns HTTP status code 200 (success) or an HTTP error and JSON describing the error. On success, the API returns the id of the newly created network.

##### example output
```` json
{
    "id" : 123456
}
````

 <a name="delete-network"></a>
### delete network
Delete a network.

	"message": "Success.",
	"context": "delete_network",
	"values": {

	}
}

````

##### example request

````

##### output

The output returns an array of networks, with each network identified by name and id.

##### example output

```` json
{
	"networks": [
		{
			"name": "unittest1",

````
GET /network/list
````

##### example request

````
GET https://api.cloudtrax.com/network/list
GET https://api-v2.cloudtrax.com/network/list
````

##### output

The API returns the list of network name/id pairs, or an empty list if no network is associated with the user sending the request.

##### example output

```` json
{
	"networks": [
		{
			"name": "hk_network",
			"id": 135587,
			"network_id": 135587, /* api-v2. new property name. same as "id" */

 <a name="get-allowed-channels"></a>
### get allowed channels
`GET /network/<network-id>/allowed_channels`

Returns all allowed channels for a network for a particular country, defaulting to the country code for the network that's stored in the database. You can specify a different country with the query-string "country" parameter, using one of the two-letter country codes specified by [ISO 3166](http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/country_codes.htm).

You can also query this information on a per-node basis; see [Node Management API](./node_management.md#get-allowed-channels-for-node).

##### example request

````
GET https://api.cloudtrax.com/network/135587/allowed_channels
